# SB-P-1.8E — Phase 4A Founder-Assisted Runtime Verification Report

**Mission:** SB-P-1.8E — Lovable Deployment Verification
**Phase:** 4A — Founder-Assisted Authenticated Runtime Verification
**Status:** IN PROGRESS — awaiting Founder-driven evidence
**Report path:** `.lovable/phase-4a-founder-assisted-runtime-verification.md`
**Prior artifacts (preserved, unchanged):**
- `.lovable/plan.md` (approved plan for this phase)
- `.lovable/phase-4-runtime-security-verification.md` (Phase 4 progress report)

## 1. Mission Summary

Founder-assisted manual runtime verification of the deployed Smart Business application at `https://smartbusiness.teamlips.com`. Lovable transcribes results and evidence supplied by the Founder; no code, routes, migrations, RLS, deployment, or credential handling occurs. Two authorized verification transactions (Sale ₹101, Purchase ₹51) will be created via the normal UI by the Founder and preserved.

## 2. Environment & Session Confirmation

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| App under test | https://smartbusiness.teamlips.com |
| Backend | Lovable Cloud (ref confirmed in prior phase) |
| Executor | Founder (manual, authenticated) + Lovable (transcription only) |
| Session confirmation | **PASS** — Founder signed in; authenticated dashboard rendered (E-A01) |
| Owner A business identity visible | **Salamath Store** |

## 3. Test Results

Each test is filled in turn-by-turn as the Founder reports back. Statuses: PASS / FAIL / BLOCKED / NOT EXECUTED.

### Test 1 — Authenticated `/transactions` route
- Steps: signed in as Owner A → open `/transactions`.
- Expected: Transactions workspace renders with Record a Sale, Record a Purchase, Transaction Timeline.
- Observed: Founder reports the Transactions page loaded successfully; Record a Sale, Record a Purchase, and Transaction Timeline surfaces are visible. E-A02 shows the authenticated Transactions view with the "Record a sale" / "Record a purchase" tabs and the Sale details form under the Salamath Store workspace header (`Workspace`, `Transactions`, `creationsflyhigh@gmail.com`, `Sign out`).
- Evidence: `E-A02` — `/mnt/documents/phase4a/E-A02_transactions.png`
- Status: **PASS**

### Test 2 — Owner A workspace observation
- Steps: within Transactions workspace, verify business identity and timeline scope.
- Expected: Only Owner A's business and its transactions are visible.
- Observed: _pending_
- Evidence: `E-A03`
- Status: _pending_
- Note: recorded as Owner-A-view only; no cross-owner isolation claim is made from this test.

### Test 3 — Authorized Sale creation (₹101)
- Values: Party `SB-P-1.8E Verification Customer`, Description `SB-P-1.8E Verification Sale`, Amount `101`, Payment `Cash`.
- Expected: success feedback → timeline row (type Sale, amount 101.00) → dashboard activity updates.
- Observed: _pending_
- Evidence: `E-A04a` (form), `E-A04b` (timeline), `E-A04c` (dashboard)
- Status: _pending_

### Test 4 — Authorized Purchase creation (₹51)
- Values: Party `SB-P-1.8E Verification Supplier`, Description `SB-P-1.8E Verification Purchase`, Amount `51`, Payment `Cash`.
- Expected: success feedback → timeline row (type Purchase, amount 51.00) → dashboard activity updates.
- Observed: _pending_
- Evidence: `E-A05a`, `E-A05b`, `E-A05c`
- Status: _pending_

### Test 5 — Append-only interface verification
- Steps: visually inspect timeline rows and any detail view for Edit / Delete / modification affordances.
- Expected: no edit, no delete, no modification form.
- Observed: _pending_
- Evidence: `E-A06`
- Status: _pending_

### Test 6 — Authentication & navigation regression
- 6a: Dashboard ↔ Transactions navigation — _pending_
- 6b: Hard refresh on `/transactions`, session persists — _pending_
- 6c: Sign out via UI — _pending_
- 6d: Signed-out `/dashboard` → expected redirect to `/auth` — _pending_
- 6e: Signed-out `/transactions` → actual behaviour (redirect vs 404) recorded verbatim — _pending_
- Evidence: `E-A07a` … `E-A07e`
- Status: _pending_

### Test 7 — Cross-business isolation availability
- Owner B fixture available? _pending Founder confirmation_
- If yes: Owner B sign-in observations and evidence `E-A08`.
- If no: record verbatim `CROSS-BUSINESS RUNTIME TEST BLOCKED — SECOND OWNER FIXTURE NOT AVAILABLE`.
- Status: _pending_

## 4. Evidence Register

Founder-supplied screenshots will be stored under `/mnt/documents/phase4a/` when attached.

## 5. Runtime Security Assessment

_To be populated strictly from observed evidence. No cross-owner isolation claim will be made unless Test 7 executes with an approved Owner B fixture._

## 6. Regressions

_To be populated._

## 7. Limitations

_To be populated. Owner B fixture availability recorded here if absent._

## 8. Overall Assessment

_Pending. One of:_
- PHASE 4 PASSED
- PHASE 4 PASSED WITH DOCUMENTED LIMITATIONS
- PHASE 4 STOPPED — SECURITY/RUNTIME ISSUE DETECTED
- PHASE 4 STOPPED — DEPLOYMENT ROUTING BLOCKER

## 9. Recommendation

_Pending completion of tests._
