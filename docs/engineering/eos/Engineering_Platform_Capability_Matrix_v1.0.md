# TEAM LIPS

# Engineering Platform Capability Matrix

## Version: v1.0

**Status:** Draft

---

**Document ID:** EOS-INFRA-002

**Artifact Type:** Engineering Infrastructure Specification

**Owner:** Team LIPS Engineering

**Mission:** SB-INF-1.8 — Engineering Platform Integration & Calibration

**Effective Version:** EOS v1.0

---

# Purpose

This document defines the capabilities of every approved engineering platform within the Team LIPS Engineering Operating System (EOS).

While the **Engineering Platform Inventory** identifies *what each platform is*, the **Engineering Platform Capability Matrix** defines *what each platform is authorized and capable of doing* within the engineering ecosystem.

This document serves as the authoritative reference for:

- Engineering workflow planning
- Platform integration
- AI collaboration
- Governance verification
- Engineering Artifact lifecycle
- Future platform evaluations

---

# Scope

This specification applies to:

- Team LIPS Engineering
- Smart Business Engineering
- Mission Control
- Founder
- ChatGPT
- Claude
- Engineering Infrastructure
